		  		<p class="title">About Sieged.ml</p>
		  		<p>Four factions fighting for land, riches, and glory battle it out in Sieged.ml. This game is being made as a fun project that will show collaboration and skill with coding on a level not done in this class to date.  Sieged is based off of a few simple .io games that everyone here has played before.  One that we all enjoyed a lot had an interesting base building mechanic that we have expanded upon here with many more building types. That game also had a small faction/team system that could have up to three people working together, we have made this one of the main focuses of Sieged where you have the four factions working against each other to gain the most control and defeat the final boss. These four factions are Greek, Roman, Norse, and Egyptian. These were chosen because of their historical significance as well as for their history of wars and empires. Sieged is made in unity and will be playable on pc and mac as long as they have an internet connection. Unity was chosen because of its easy interface and C# programming language. Unity also makes it easy to port games to other platforms.  </p>

				<p class="title">Why make this?</p>
				<p>We made this game because we felt like the games that were out there were fun but could use some changes, so thatâ€™s what we did.  We took ideas from a few different games that we had played and adapted and changed the mechanics until it became its own thing.</p>
